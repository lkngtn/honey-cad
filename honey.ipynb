    "This model aims to create a simulation of the 1hive economy, it assumes that 1hive can capture fee inflows by directing outflows towards productive activities and represents this growth potential as a logistic curve that represents market saturation. We assume that outflows will result in increased market saturation, and that participants will increase outflows when the perceived opportunity for growth is higher, and reduce outflows as the opportunity for growth decreases. \n",
    "    \n",
    "For the purpose of this model we differentiate the honey supply into two buckets, the common pool and the circulating supply. We model inflows to the system (in stable value terms) as a function of saturation and market size, and have saturation decay over time. We define a conversion price that adjusts each timestep as a ratio of market cap to inflows divided by saturation, and use this price to model inflows as a movement of honey from the circulating supply into the common pool. \n",
    "\n",
    "We set an outflow boundary from the common pool as an abstraction of how conviction voting limits the **maximum possible outflow rate from a pool of funds given a certain parameterization of conviction voting**, though in practice the real outflow rate would tend to be much lower than this boundary due to the ability for participants to support signaling proposals (eg abstain), or for proposal to recieve some support but ultimately fail to reach sufficient support to execute. To reflect the expected behavior of participants to modulate outflows based on their perception of the growth potential we make the actual outflow rate adjust based on level of saturation. \n",

    "We are interested in exploring parameter choices for internal mechanisms and analzying the sensitivity to parameters of environmental processes to better understand how the protocol will respond in terms of price, supply, and common pool reserves across various stages of growth. \n",
