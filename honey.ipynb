    "This model aims to create a simulation of the 1hive economy, it assumes that 1hive can capture fee inflows by directing outflows towards productive activities and represents this growth potential as a logistic curve that represents market saturation. We assume that outflows will result in increased market saturation, and that participants will increase outflows when the perceived opportunity for growth is higher, and reduce outflows as the opportunity for growth decreases. \n",
    "    \n",
    "For the purpose of this model we differentiate the honey supply into two buckets, the common pool and the circulating supply. We model inflows to the system (in stable value terms) as a function of saturation and market size, and have saturation decay over time. We define a conversion price that adjusts each timestep as a ratio of market cap to inflows divided by saturation, and use this price to model inflows as a movement of honey from the circulating supply into the common pool. \n",
    "\n",
    "We set an outflow boundary from the common pool as an abstraction of how conviction voting limits the **maximum possible outflow rate from a pool of funds given a certain parameterization of conviction voting**, though in practice the real outflow rate would tend to be much lower than this boundary due to the ability for participants to support signaling proposals (eg abstain), or for proposal to recieve some support but ultimately fail to reach sufficient support to execute. To reflect the expected behavior of participants to modulate outflows based on their perception of the growth potential we make the actual outflow rate adjust based on level of saturation. \n",

    "We have 4 different subsets of data based on different parameters. \n",

    "* subset 3: 20% reserve target, 0.05 outflow rate from the common pool per month, no throttle, and 0.02 inflows\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a 20% reserve target and 0.05 maxiumum outflow rate as a baseline. Even with a 20% reserve target, the outflow rate and lack of inflows result in a equilibrium reserve of around 18%, if we conservatively assume the maximum outflow rate of 0.05 of the common pool, we end up with a max of ~10.8% issuance per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the base case we do not specify the issuance rate, we only specify the target and conviction voting parameters that control the maximum outflow. However, if we want to define a maximum issuance rate directly we can use the throttle paramter. In subset 1, this is set to 0.004 or 4.8% per year, resulting in a reserve that stabilizes around 7.5%. It's worth noting that separting the max issuance rate from the conviction parameters, we can potentially remove governance over the max issuance (throttle), while retaining the ability to adjust conviction parameterization as needed, and we can more easily explain the maximum issuance rate without having to explain conviction voting parameterization in-depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we would expect the actual outflows to be much lower than theoretical maximum allows by a given set of conviction parameters. In subset 2, I turned the throttle back off but reduced the outflow rate by half. Reducing outflow rate results in slower overall supply growth, and the reserve stabilizing at a bit higher. From a system perspective, this means that if Honey holders choose to stake honey on the abstain proposals they would effectively be voting to reduce both the spending and the issuance rate. This ensures that honey holders do not have an incentive to overspend, because they always have the option to abstain and reduce issuance and outflows if they do not think any of the current proposals provide positive expected future value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in subset 4, I've set inflows to be greater than outflows, showing how over time this results in the reserves increasing beyond the target, and the supply of Honey decreasing as honey is burned from the common pool. Inflows are specified as a fixed ratio of the circulating supply in the model, which is completely arbitrary, but does help illustrate how consistent net inflows would impact both the total supply and reserves. Total supply would become deflationary, while the reserve would stabilize above the target reserve ratio. \n",
